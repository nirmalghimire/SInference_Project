Statistical Inference
Peer-Graded Assignment
Overview: 
This is a class project for Statistical Inference Course in Data Science Certification Program through John Hopkins University. This project conducts thousands of simulations of data of exponential distribution in R and assess how their means and variance compare with the theoretical ones. The second half of the project analyzes the ToothGrowth data and performs some basic exploratory analyses.  
Part 1: Simulation Exercise Instructions
This project investigates the exponential distribution in R and compares it with the Central Limit Theorem. The exponential distribution was simulated in R using ‘rexp (n, lambda)’. If you are not sure, exponential distribution has a mean and standard deviation of 1 over lambda (1/ʎ). Lambda was set to (0.2) for all the simulations. This project investigates the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials using a thousand of simulations. 
This project attempted to answer following questions:
1.	Does the sample mean vary from the theoretical mean? 
2.	Calculate the sample variance and compare it with the theoretical variance of the distribution. 
3.	Check if the distribution is approximately normal.
The answer to question 3 should focus on the difference between the distribution of a large collection of random exponentials and the distribution of a large collection of averages of 40 exponentials.
A.	Simulating data in R 
B.	Calculating Sample Mean and Theoretical Mean Using Simulated Data 
C.	Calculating Sample Variance and Theoretical Variance Using Simulated Data
D.	Checking Data Distribution and Assessing if they are Approximately Normal


Part 2: Basic Inferential Data Analysis Instructions
This second portion of the project analyzes the ToothGrowth data in the R dataset package and performs the following activities:
1.	Basic Exploratory Data Analyses:
2.	Basic Summary of the Data:
3.	Use Confidence Intervals (CI) and/or hypothesis tests to compare tooth growth by supp and dose:
4.	State conclusion and the assumptions needed for conclusion
